# ADI-2024-Pre-Screening-Assessment

### README Instructions

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in this year's Applied Data Institute.

### Purpose

The purpose of this notebook is to evaluate your proficiency in Python programming and your ability to approach novel technical challenges computationally. There are two main categories of tasks in this notebook:

1. **Core Tasks**: These tasks assess your programming skills and computational thinking.
2. **Data Tasks**: As the name suggests, these tasks involve working with various forms of data.

### Task Requirements

- **Core Tasks**: Please attempt at least 2 out of the 3 core tasks.
- **Data Tasks**: Please attempt at least 1 out of the 3 data tasks.

### Time Allotment

You have 24 hours to complete as much of the notebook as possible. The tasks are intentionally designed to be challenging, so it is acceptable to leave some tasks blank or partially complete. If there are tasks that you are unsure how to approach, feel free to skip them. However, tackling more tasks will provide us with a better understanding of your technical critical thinking and computational creativity.

### Guidelines

- **Code Comments**: Please comment your code extensively. Use Python notebooks' full functionality to explain your thought process in detail. We are particularly interested in understanding the rationale behind your code rather than just the code itself.
  
- **Submission**: The notebook will automatically submit itself at the end of the 24-hour period, after which you will lose edit access. If you have worked on your answers elsewhere, ensure they are transferred to this notebook before the deadline.

- **Note on Cheating/Plagiarism**: This assessment is open-book, encouraging research and the use of online resources. However, the final notebook submitted must be your own work. Collaboration with others on this notebook is not allowed. Please refrain from using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to generate code or explanations; instead, use them as a guide in your research process, similar to how one would use Wikipedia.

We hope you find this assessment both challenging and enjoyable. Approach it with a positive attitude towards learning and stretching your mental abilities.
